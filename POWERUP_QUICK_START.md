## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Single Player Testing
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
powerUpIntegration.addPowerUpToInventory('nitro');
powerUpIntegration.addPowerUpToInventory('shield');
powerUpIntegration.addPowerUpToInventory('emp');
```

### Multiplayer Testing
1. Open multiple browser tabs/windows
2. All should connect to the same room
3. Test power-up interactions between players
4. Verify visual effects sync across clients

### Performance Testing
```javascript
// Stress test - add many power-ups:
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    powerUpIntegration.addPowerUpToInventory('nitro');
    setTimeout(() => powerUpIntegration.usePowerUp(0), i * 100);
}
```

## üîß Debug Tools

### Console Commands
```javascript
// Get power-up system reference
const powerUpSystem = powerUpIntegration.getPowerUpSystem();

// Check inventory
console.log(powerUpSystem.playerInventory);

// Check active power-ups
console.log(powerUpSystem.activePowerUps);

// Get sound settings
console.log(powerUpIntegration.getSoundManager().getSettings());

// Force spawn power-up
powerUpSystem.spawnPowerUp();
```

### Visual Debugging
- Power-up inventory shows at bottom center
- Active power-ups display in status panel (top left)
- Chat shows power-up events
- Console logs all power-up activities

### Audio Debugging
- Press **M** to toggle sound on/off
- Check browser console for audio context warnings
- Ensure browser allows audio autoplay

## üéÆ Gameplay Tips

### For Testing
1. **Start with Nitro** - Easy to see and feel the effect
2. **Test Shield** - Deliberately hit obstacles to verify protection
3. **Use EMP in Groups** - More effective with multiple players nearby
4. **Time Rewind** - Drive in circles, then rewind to see effect
5. **Smoke Screen** - Follow your own trail to test visibility

### Strategy Tips
1. **Collect Aggressively** - Only 3 inventory slots, use them
2. **Save Defensive** - Keep shield/star for dangerous sections
3. **Offensive Combos** - EMP then missile for maximum effect
4. **Positioning** - Some power-ups require proximity to be effective

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Sound
- Check if browser allows autoplay
- Verify Web Audio API support
- Press **M** to toggle sound
- Check browser console for audio errors

#### Power-ups Not Spawning
- Check console for spawn errors
- Verify Three.js scripts loaded correctly
- Ensure power-up classes are registered

#### Visual Effects Missing
- Check WebGL support in browser
- Verify Three.js version compatibility
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

#### Multiplayer Sync Issues
- Verify socket.io connection (green status)
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Ensure all players are in same room

### Performance Issues
- Reduce particle count in settings
- Close other browser tabs
- Check system resources (RAM/GPU)
- Lower graphics quality if needed

## üìä Expected Performance

- **Normal**: 50-100 MB
- **High**: 150-200 MB with many effects
- **Critical**: Over 300 MB (memory leak)

### Network Traffic
- **Idle**: <1 KB/s
- **Active**: 5-10 KB/s during power-up usage
- **Peak**: 20-30 KB/s with multiple simultaneous effects

## üìù Logging and Analytics

### What Gets Logged
- Power-up spawn events
- Collection events
- Usage events
