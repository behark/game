# Speed Rivals - Fixes Applied (October 19, 2025)

## ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. **THREE.js and CANNON.js Loading Errors** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** 
- Browser error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'`
- Game stuck on "Loading Speed Rivals..." screen
- Libraries in `libs/` directory were ES6 module versions instead of UMD builds

**Root Cause:**
- `libs/three.min.js` and `libs/cannon.min.js` contained ES6 `export` statements
- ES6 modules are incompatible with regular `<script>` tags (require `<script type="module">`)

**Solution:**
- Downloaded correct browser-compatible UMD builds from CDN:
  - THREE.js v0.160.0 (655KB) from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.160.0/build/three.min.js`
  - CANNON.js v0.6.2 (130KB) from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cannon@0.6.2/build/cannon.min.js`
- Replaced old ES6 module files with new UMD builds
- Verified files end with proper UMD closure (no export statements)

**Result:** ✅ **Game loads and runs successfully in browser!**

---

### 2. **Content Security Policy Violation** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
```
Refused to connect to 'https://infragrid.v.network/wallet/getnodeinfo' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 
"connect-src 'self' *.stripe.com api.stripe.com"
```

**Solution:**
- Updated CSP in `server.js` to allow connections to `*.v.network`:
```javascript
connectSrc: ["'self'", "*.stripe.com", "api.stripe.com", "*.v.network"]
```

**Result:** ✅ **External wallet API calls no longer blocked**

---

### 3. **Missing Analytics Endpoint** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
```
POST /api/analytics/client-error 404 (Not Found)
```

**Solution:**
- Added client-side error reporting endpoint in `routes/analytics.js`:
```javascript
router.post('/client-error', async (req, res) => {
  // Logs client errors to server console
  logger.error('Client-side error reported', { error, stack, userAgent, url });
  res.json({ success: true, message: 'Error logged' });
});
```

**Result:** ✅ **Client errors properly logged on server**

---

### 4. **THREE.js Material Warnings** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
```
THREE.Material: 'emissive' is not a property of THREE.MeshBasicMaterial.
```

**Solution:**
- Changed `MeshBasicMaterial` to `MeshStandardMaterial` for materials needing emissive properties:
  - Spark particles
  - Fire particles
  - Sun/Moon objects
- Added proper emissive properties:
```javascript
new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0xffaa00,
  emissive: 0xff6600,
  emissiveIntensity: 1,
  metalness: 0.5,
  roughness: 0.5
})
```

**Result:** ✅ **No more material property warnings**

---

### 5. **Express Trust Proxy Warning** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
```
ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header is set but the Express 'trust proxy' setting is false
```

**Solution:**
- Added trust proxy setting in `server.js`:
```javascript
app.set('trust proxy', true);
```

**Result:** ✅ **Proper IP detection in development environment**

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/game/speed-rivals
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   - Navigate to forwarded port URL (e.g., `https://...github.dev-3000.app.github.dev/`)
   - Game should load and display 3D racing environment

3. **Controls:**
   - Arrow keys or WASD for movement
   - Space for brake
   - (See in-game controls for full list)
